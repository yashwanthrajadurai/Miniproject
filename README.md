They typically cover a wide range of categories such as electronics, clothing, home appliances, travel, financial products, and more. Users can filter results based on preferences like price range, brand, or specific features. Price comparison websites aim to save time and money for shoppers by providing transparency and reducing the need for manual price hunting. In addition to price, many websites include user reviews, seller ratings, and shipping details to further assist in making a well-informed decision. Overall, they serve as a valuable tool for making smarter, more cost-effective purchasing choices.
